Practical exercise
==========================
 
Create an Android application which has the following features:


FEATURES
* show a list of transactions corresponding to an account (Android.Transactions.png)
* Example data has been included (exercise.json)
* On this screen, ensure that the account information on top scrolls off the screen (Android.Transactions.Scrolling.png)
* note that the transactions (both cleared and pending) should be shown in a combined list, by descending date order


BONUS MARKS
* Group transactions by date
* Some transactions will be ATM withdrawals. These rows should be indicated by the location icon.
* Tapping on an ATM withdrawal row will show the location of the ATM on a map
* Implement an algorithm that will give the user a projected spend over the next two weeks
* Dynamically pull down data from https://www.dropbox.com/s/tewg9b71x0wrou9/data.json?dl=1

The required image files have been supplied.

You can spend as much time as you like on this, but we recommend about 3hrs for this exercise.

This is all the information we can provide, so if you have questions, please make assumptions.

Please send us your source code, the APK file, and any notes you wish to include, in a zip archive
