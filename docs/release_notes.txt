Version 0.1

Feature list:

* show a list of transactions corresponding to an account (Android.Transactions.png)
* Example data has been included (exercise.json)
* On this screen, ensure that the account information on top scrolls off the screen (Android.Transactions.Scrolling.png)
* transactions (both cleared and pending) should be shown in a combined list, by descending date order

* Group transactions by date
* Some transactions will be ATM withdrawals. These rows should be indicated by the location icon.
* Dynamically pull down data from https://www.dropbox.com/s/tewg9b71x0wrou9/data.json?dl=1

Assumptions:

 - This exercise is looking for a simple solution that can meet the requirements, not architectures supposing scalability
 - The test was think to be done in 3 hours, therefore not a big focus on testing architecture is required (can be done upon request)
 - for "location icon" the provided asset marker_atm_commbank can be used
 - the prefix text "Wdl" on a transaction description indicates it's a withdrawal.
